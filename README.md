# Bitcoin-price-prediction

This project aims to discover the most efficient and highest accuracy model to predict Bitcoin prices from various machine learning algorithms, considering multiple parameters that affect the Bitcoin value. 

It is achieved with varying degrees of success by implementing##  a Bayesian optimized recurrent neural network (RNN) and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network.


## Proposed Methodology

Optimized RNN and LSTM models are developed and compared for the model with the highest overlap of true and predicted values. 

Upon metric evaluation, it is concluded that LSTM model outperforms bayesian optimized RNN.
